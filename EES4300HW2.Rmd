```{r}
library(ggplot2)
metal = c("Cu", "Pb", "Zn", "Sn", "Hg", "Cd")
reserves = c(690, 85, 250, 1.8, 0.093, 0.64)
UCavg = c(23, 17.5, 61, 4, 0.035, 0.0885)
df = data.frame(metal, reserves, UCavg)
ggplot(df, aes(reserves, UCavg, color = metal)) + geom_point() + xlab("Reserves (MMT)") + ylab("UC Avg (ppm)") + ggtitle("Upper Crustal Abundance vs. Base Metal Reserves")

```

Based on the above plot, the base metal that falls off the trend is Cu. This is because the rest of the base metals seem to have a direct relationship between upper crustal abundance and reserves. However, Cu has a relatively low upper crustal abundance but a relatively very high amount of reserves. This differs from the trend of the rest of the base metals.
